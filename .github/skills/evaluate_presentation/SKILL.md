# Evaluate Presentation Skill

When you are asked to evaluate a presentation slide or document (`.qmd`, `.pptx`, etc.):

1. **Analyze the Core Message**: Identify the single most important takeaway. If it's not immediately obvious, flag the slide as ineffective.
2. **Assess Cognitive Load**: Check for chart junk, excessive bullet points, or competing visual elements. Recommend ruthless pruning of anything that doesn't serve the core message.
3. **Check the Title**: Verify if the title is an active assertion rather than a passive topic.
4. **Deliver Honest Feedback**: State flaws directly based on objective design principles. Do not soften the blow or be overly polite. State what is wrong, why it is wrong, and how to fix it.
