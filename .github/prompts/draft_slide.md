# Draft a New Slide

When drafting a new presentation slide, follow these steps strictly:

1. **Define the Takeaway**: Write down the single core takeaway for the new slide.
2. **Write the Title**: Draft the slide title. It MUST be an assertion (a complete sentence making a point), not a topical noun phrase.
3. **Outline Evidence**: Outline the minimal evidence required to support the assertion. This should be 2-3 supporting points or a specification for a data visualization.
4. **Review and Cut**: Review the draft against the design rules. Remove any redundant words or fluff. If something is not essential to the assertion, delete it.
