# Presentation Design Principles

- **Clarity over embellishment**: Keep slides lean. Maximize the data-ink ratio.
- **Assertion-Evidence Structure**: Slide titles should be assertions (e.g., "Revenue grew by 20% due to X"), supported by evidence (data/visuals), rather than topical phrases (e.g., "Revenue Data").
- **One key message per slide**: If a slide has multiple divergent points, ruthlessly cut the less important ones or split the slide.
- **Visual hierarchy**: Use size, weight, and contrast to direct the viewer's eye to the most critical information first.
